# **NOTE: THIS IS A [PRIVATE](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib#assert_private) CLASS**
#
# The SIMP 'Lite' Scenario
#
# This is a minimal configuration that enables the majority of the SIMP
# management components but does not enable some of the items that users have
# found difficult to integrate into legacy infrastructures in the past.
#
# **NOTE** This will **NOT** pass many Certification evaluations for various
# standards but may provide you with an acceptable risk scenario for your
# environment.
#
# Namely, the following items are not included by default (please feel free to
# include the ones that you want as possible:
#
# * firewall
# * fips
# * selinux
# * tcpwrappers
# * svckill
# * PAM host access controls
#
# For additional details on how to make global changes within the SIMP
# framework, please see the ``simp_options`` module documentation
# http://www.puppetmodule.info/github/simp/pupmod-simp-simp_options/master/
